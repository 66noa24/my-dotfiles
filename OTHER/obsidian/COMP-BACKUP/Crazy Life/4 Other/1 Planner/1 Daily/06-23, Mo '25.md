### Journal:
**23:16** | Today went super good!! I was in a much better mood. I've been taking my medication on time, and it has definitely been helping with my mood. I was thinking about making a poem about this aspect of my bipolar. 
	*I get to fall in love with you, over and over.*
But, of course, this highlights the negatives of the lows.

What I also did today was complete my [[Future Careers]]. I got five options and now in the next month figure out a plan for after graduation. I've definitely left a lot of opportunities go. I don't know if this is something I can blame on my Bipolar. (Should I be blaming anything on my bipolar?) But I feel so much less anxious about it now. I just need to outline the steps and do them. That's it. 

[[06-24, Tu '25|Tmrw]] I am going to [[Cami]]'s house with [[Zeyda]] and [[Paige]]. We're going swimming!
