### Journal:
**10:20 PM** | I think I'm slipping into a depressive episode. I don't know. But this is really pissing me off because *I KNEW* when it was going to happen. I literally fucking projected it!
**Sep** - *4m* - **Jan** = Depressive
**Jan** - *5m* - **May** = Hypo/"Up"
And now I'm going back down. So, Crisis mode. I need to decrease the friction. I need to be able to sit down and do school work. You know all this already. Really this conversation is just more for documentation.
**10:26 PM** | You know, I never thought of that, how I can think of this planner as documentation for me. Because that's really what It is.
**10:38 PM** | So, just fuck me. I'm practically done with this shit. I have another year to do stuff. I don't know. Pass?
