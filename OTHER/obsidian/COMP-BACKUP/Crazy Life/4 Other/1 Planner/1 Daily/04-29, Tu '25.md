**06:58 AM** | okay, so it is early in the morning. I'm doing this right now just so maybe I can help we find myself up a little bit. You can't hear my voice. But trust me my voice is slurring like I'm drunk. Today is the AP chapter 12 exam. I'm going to bomb it. And stuff with drayson it's going well.
**12:58 PM** | I have a ==53== in AP gov' right now... My finial grade if i graduated right now would be 68.5. My grade for this class *can* get down to 51% before I start to fail. I really just want school to be done.
