**07:39** | Good morning! I'm pretty sure why my mood was weird was because I've taken only half of my Seroquel the past two night. I've been going to bed late, and don't want to take a whole one if It's going to make it hard for me to wake up at 07:00 to feed the dogs.

**07:43** | But omg Fin fucking barks ALL THE TIME. AT NOTHING!
