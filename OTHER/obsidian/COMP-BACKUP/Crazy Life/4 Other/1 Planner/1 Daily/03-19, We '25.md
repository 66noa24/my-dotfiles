### Journal
**10:01 AM** | No therapy today because Zeb is sick. Mom said he sounded gross.
**10:49 PM** | So, I just left from Draysons not to long ago, I left around 22:00, but, there was a flipped truck right past the truck ramp. There is traffic closed the entire way down the mountain. I'm currently sitting right at the top. If traffic starts moving from turning around then I'll go back and stay at Draysons. Im silently hoping i'll be able to turn around, but I'm not really sure. I texted my mom, but, she is asleep and will be confused when she realizes I'm not home. So, in the meantime I'm going to be working on my alpha…
