Like I have enough for the two weeks, and I wasn't pulling money from my savings account. The only thing honestly I need to work on is making sure I actually track my spending. I think the act of manually typing them in is good for me, keeping me aware of my spending. But that's also creates just enough friction for me to sometimes forget it. I'm always super good at tracking then I'm like the first 5 days.
