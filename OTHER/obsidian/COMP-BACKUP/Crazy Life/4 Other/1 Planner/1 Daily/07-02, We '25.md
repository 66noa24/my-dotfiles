**10:20** | I guess I'm going up to draysons again today. Going to try and take some more of my stuff back from my drawer there. Ava is in the hospital, she might have a spinal fluid leak or a chiari malformation type 1. I'm worried about her, but the prognosis was good. It's something shit.
**10:54** | I guess now I'm going to the Belleville sale instead. Not a bad thing. And because I *need* to be up at aunt danas around three, I'll be able to get my pouches. Maybe I'll still stay the night idk. I want fucked.
**22:13** | so, I was literally going to break up with him. (With him now)  I was almost crying the whole way here. He pissed me off today, I got back from aunt Danas at 1600!! And I waited until 1900!!! Three hours for him to just go on a Lyft. I fucking went home cause wth. I literally scripted what I was going to say. But I get here, I walk in, and what does he remind me of? THE SHORTS HE GAVE ME. Idk if I have them or not but it stopped me in my tracks. So, I guess I'm staying another night with a man I do **not love**.
