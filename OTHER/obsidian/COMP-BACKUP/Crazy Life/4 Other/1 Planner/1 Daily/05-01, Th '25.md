### Journal:
**14:08** | I really need to start journaling more. I feel like sometimes I don't feel like I have enough time to myself. But if I started journaling more, and just kind of having my own little space to voice my thoughts. Then maybe I feel better being more busy in my life. So on that topic, right now I'm getting ready for work. I'm about to get in the shower. Draysons car is working now. He just got a registered. I'm happy for him. And then this [[05-02, Fr '25|friday]] we're going to be able to work on his car. (Made with V2T)

**15:07** |so I just finished my shower. I definitely took a lot longer than I normally would. I need to leave for work at 15:30. I was just looking online, and I found something called "36 questions to fall in love". And I'm going to see how I can implement that with jason, in a more subtle way. Maybe asking two or three questions a day and whenever I'm there. But nothing huge like I don't want really to do the entire thing with him. But maybe that's just my self-consciousness.
