### Journal:
**13:26** | I just left the high school, I was talking with kennington. Everything is mostly figured out. She said that I'm going to be checking my email pretty often because I might get an email from HACC. She said that I would have contact information about an advisor and that they would be a good person for me to talk to about what my next step should be. Especially you know what courses would be beneficial for me if I am going to hack for cybersecurity and networking.
