**15:30** | Today is going really good actually! I woke up a few times this morning to go shit, but, really I was in bed till like 13:00. But, alls good now. I took my meds last night and my Wellbutrin this morning! I think the MediSafe app I got will help me more with remembering to take my medications. Plus, I get a like report. I think this might be something I am able to record in my [[1 Episode tracking|episode tracking]]? We'll see. I go to work, now. Actually. Shit, didn't know it was this late! After work, I'm going to work more on my laptop. Maybe with programming or something? Lol, maybe figure out WTF to do with my life now.

**23:46** | Draysons now,

**06-21 '25**, **00:02** | paid off ZIP!
