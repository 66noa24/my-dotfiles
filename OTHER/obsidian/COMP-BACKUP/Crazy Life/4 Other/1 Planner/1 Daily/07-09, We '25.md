### Misc':

### Journal:
**22:17** | Okay, so, today has been alright. Still not taking my lithium, i honestly don't even know where it is right now. Probably something I could look for tonight I guess. Also, tmrw i **am** planning on breaking up with him. Before work too, so, we'll see how the emotions are flowing at work. But, i'll be working with [[Cassandra]], so i'll get my evening to talk to her about it. I'm also just kind of like whatever about it. Like, i've already made my mind up about it. Now I just need to rip the bandaid off.

I've also been grossing myself out a little bit. Like, I just shaved off what was the longest my facial hair ever was. Not a fan. Plus i'm smoking cigs again (wtf, ig they're just my "low go to"), and i have the bad breath from them.

**22:26** | Also just now realizing it *is* 1/2 way done with the year. So what the FUCK is this shit?!
