**17:21** | so like the past two days I haven't really been doing much on here. I'm really ever since I went to Isaac's house on Saturday. I haven't take my meds the past 2 days. I'll should be cuz I went to Isaac's house. I went there and as I was leaving around 1:00 a.m. and a fucking handed me this handle of 40 proof alcohol called unicorn's milk. I've been more or less drunk the past two nights. And it makes me anxious to take my meds while I'm drinking. And this morning whenever I was at Syds to babysit Mayuana I was asleep the entire time. Whenever my sister got back I pretty much told her that I was here for like 2 hours cuz all the other times I was asleep.
