**01:05** | I'm honestly like, really ready for school to start. I'm ready to be doing shit and have a routine. But, my life is doing pretty good right now. I feel like I've set myself up good, and now i can just kind of sit and do what I need to to not fall off of it. I'm setting up with laptop with an SD card (or trying. it hasn't been doing to hot recently) so that I have my own OS dedicated for school and stuff. But, honestly that's what my entire laptop is for... Sooo.... IDK. I do know that I will be leaving my desktop up at home with a VNC server running so i can access it from school or where ever. I def need to make sure I'm **BAKED** before school!
