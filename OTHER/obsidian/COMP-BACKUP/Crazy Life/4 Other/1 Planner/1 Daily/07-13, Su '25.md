**12:09** | I did take my lithium yesterday! I *need* to call today about my Rx script. I don't even have enough lithium for another dose. Maybe I'll just run in person.

**14:53** | So, we did find my lithium. Even before we found the other bottle, i had like 2 days left. But now i'm good. Also not sure if the time me being off lithium pushed me into an up. 

**22:23** | Just got back from work, gonna get a quick bath and then do some stuff on my laptop. I'm bored. Maybe I should do something productive
