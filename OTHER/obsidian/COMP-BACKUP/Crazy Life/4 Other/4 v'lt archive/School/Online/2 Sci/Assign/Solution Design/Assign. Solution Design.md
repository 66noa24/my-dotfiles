## Design-thinking process
1. **Empathize**
	Understand the needs and challenges of users.  
	Application: In healthcare, doctors observe and listen to patients to grasp their health challenges deeply.
2. **Define**
	- Articulate the problem based on insights.
	- Application: Educators identify specific learning gaps or challenges based on student interactions.
3. **Ideate** 
	- Generate creative solutions to the problem.
	- Application: Tech companies brainstorm features for new apps that solve user problems, like time management
4. **Prototype**
	- Create a tangible version of ideas.
	- Application: Product designers develop prototypes, such as an eco-friendly water bottle, to explore design feasibility.
5. **Test**
	- Share the prototype with users for feedback.
	- Application: Software developers release a beta version of new tools to select users, using their feedback to guide refinements
