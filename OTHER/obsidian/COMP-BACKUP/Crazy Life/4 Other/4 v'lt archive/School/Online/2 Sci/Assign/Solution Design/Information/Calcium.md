### Uses
- Extracted from limestone
	- Glass blowing
	- construction
- It is used for <u>fertilization</u> 

#### Impacts
- Nutrition uptake is affected
	- When there is too much calcium, it can inhibit the uptake of other nutrients
	- Calcium can take up sites meant for nutrient uptake
	- The excess calcium can also lead to PH changes, especially in alkaline soils. 
		- This limits iron uptake
- Soil structure degradation
	- Calcium decreases room for aggregation, causing dense solid soil profile
	- Excess calcium inhibits water retention, leading to fewer nutrients held by the soil
	- Water runoff
		- Impacted soil disallows for water infiltration, leading to erosion of the topsoil. 
		- Also bad when this sediment erodes into local waterways.

Research in China highlights that median calcium values in both topsoil and deep soils were measured at 1.96% and 1.84%, respectively.<u> This indicates a significant presence of calcium, which may need to be managed carefully to avoid issues with nutrient uptake</u>.
