Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Levels
	There has been steady increase in CO2 levels, and is currently at 420 PPM
Temp Data
	Up until the 1960s, the Temperature and solar energy were about the same, then the temperature started rising constantly, and the received energy from the sun is continuing to drop.
Wildfire damage
	Until 200, there was never more than 5 million acres burned, then it reached 6 in 200, and has been slowly rising until reaching close to 10 million acres in 2020.

My explanation
	Earth has been impacted by increasing CO2 levels by increasing the earth temperature and promoting more wildfires. CO2 levels and global temperature averages increase at the same rate. As well as the frequency of wildfires is also increasing with them. This provides evidence by showing the order of events, and how CO2 levels directly affects our environment.
