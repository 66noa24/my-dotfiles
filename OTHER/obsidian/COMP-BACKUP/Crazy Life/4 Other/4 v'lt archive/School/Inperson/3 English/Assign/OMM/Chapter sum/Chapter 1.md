*   The chapter begins by describing Crooks' living quarters in the harness room, separate from the bunkhouse due to his race and physical disability. It details his few personal possessions, highlighting his solitary but relatively permanent position on the ranch and his proud, independent nature.
*   On Saturday night, Crooks is alone in his room, tending to his back pain. Lennie appears in his doorway, having come to check on his puppy and seeing Crooks' light. Despite Crooks' initial attempts to assert his right to privacy and exclude Lennie due to racial segregation, Lennie's persistent, simple desire for companionship leads Crooks to reluctantly invite him in.
*   As they talk, Lennie excitedly shares the dream of owning a farm with George and tending the rabbits. Crooks initially dismisses this as a common, unrealistic fantasy among transient workers, reflecting his own bitter experience with unfulfilled dreams and loneliness. He also tests Lennie by suggesting George might not return, causing Lennie significant distress before Crooks backs down.
*   Candy arrives, also looking for Lennie, and is invited into Crooks' room, marking the first time he has entered the stable buck's quarters. Candy enthusiastically discusses his financial contribution to the dream farm plan and how they can profit from the rabbits, further solidifying the shared vision among the three marginalized men. Crooks, witnessing their tangible plan and shared hope, expresses interest in joining them, offering his labor for free.
*   Curley's wife then appears in the doorway, disrupting the gathering and seeking attention. She expresses her loneliness and dissatisfaction with her life, particularly with Curley. She notices Lennie's bruised face and correctly deduces that he was the one who broke Curley's hand, despite the men's attempts to cover it up. When the men try to get her to leave, she becomes aggressive, using her position and race to intimidate them, particularly Crooks, threatening to have him lynched if he speaks out of turn. Faced with this severe racial threat, Crooks is psychologically defeated and withdraws his interest in the dream farm.
*   George arrives, looking for Lennie and visibly displeased to find him and Candy in Crooks' room. As George takes Lennie and Candy away, Crooks calls out to Candy and explicitly retracts his offer to join their dream, stating he was just fooling and wouldn't want to go to such a place. The chapter concludes with Crooks alone again in his room, returning to his isolated routine, suggesting the brief flicker of hope brought by shared dreams has been extinguished by the harsh realities of their social hierarchy and prejudice.
