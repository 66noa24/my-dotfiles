- **Proctor** (Bouy)
	Evidence:
	 	Proctor, handing Danforth a paper: Will you read this first, sir? It’s a sort of testament. The people signing it declare their good opinion of Rebecca, and my wife, and Martha Corey. Danforth looks down at the paper.
	Analysis:
		This shows Proctors level-headed thinking, and systematic approach to proving that they are just making stuff up. Also, the fact that he had a physical paper vs. than just his word shows that he understands how easily the court is swayed by public opinion.
- **Paris** (Problem)
	Evidence:
		“Aye, faint. Prove to us how you pretended in the court so many times. Mary Warren, looking to Proctor: I — cannot faint now, sir. Proctor, alarmed, quietly: 'Can you not pretend it?'”
	Analysis:
		Similar to Abigail, he is good at twisting peoples words. He here is constantly trying to grab at something to make Danforth basically just punish them. 
- Giles (Bouy)
	Evidence:
		Giles Voice: Thomas Putnam is reaching out for land
		Giles, through helpless sobs: It is my third wife, sir; I never had no wife that be so taken with books, and I thought to find the cause of it, d’y’see, but it were no witch I blamed her for. 
	Analysis:
		Despite his behavior in court, he offers alternative motives for these trials aside from simply to catch the witches. He also provides evidence for why his wife is not a witch. Similar to proctor, but a contrast to how the courts have been operating.
