The search results provide some insight into the changes in society and technology that transformed the partisan press in the early 1800s, but do not explicitly list six changes. However, synthesizing information from the search results, here are some key factors that contributed to this transformation:

1.  **Technological Advancements in Printing:** The introduction of technologies like the cylinder press and steam power significantly increased the speed and efficiency of printing [6, 3]. The cylinder press, for example, allowed for paper to be fed through ten times more quickly than before.
2.  **Rise of the Penny Press:** The emergence of the penny press revolutionized news production and distribution by making newspapers more affordable and accessible to a wider audience [3]. This shift moved away from reliance on subscriptions and political funding.
3.  **Increased Literacy Rates:** Higher literacy rates in the 1830s created a larger readership for newspapers, contributing to the popularization of mass circulation [6].
4.  **Shift Towards Objective Journalism:** There was a growing acknowledgement of the need for more credible, less biased sources [8]. Publications that claimed objectivity grew in appeal, moving away from explicit political affiliation [1].
5.  **Political Changes & Expansion:** The First Party System (1790s-1810s) saw rapid growth in the American press as parties sponsored papers [5]. The expansion of suffrage to include all adult, white males led to more hotly contested politics [5].
6.  **Alternative Press:** The alternative press played a significant role by becoming an outlet for voices of social protest, such as in the emancipation and women's suffrage movements [4].
