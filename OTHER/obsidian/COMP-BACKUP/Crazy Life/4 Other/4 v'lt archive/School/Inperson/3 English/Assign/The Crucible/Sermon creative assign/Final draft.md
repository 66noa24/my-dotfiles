You megalithic masses of people, devoid of empathy and concern. 
The psychopathic factories you continue, pumping rodent after rodent into the streets, to watch them burn and ash. Lacking the ethic to do something other than the rest. 
You are no better than the people who go out and slaughter the living! The apathy you all hold runs as crimson as the savages knives you yourselves watch! The blood that coats your calloused souls is evidence that your self labeled ignorance is plainly a contradiction. 
You all rot from in the inside out, and do not notice until you're taken wholly, and you yourself are the one under the same bloody knife. Do all of you lack the meditation to notice these faults, these chasms? Hardly! It is you people who would choose ignorance for the price of someone else's life. 
You all who barter with the Devil as such, do not be fooled. You are not safe. The fiery blade that will come does not discriminate. The merit of your life *will* consume you at the finial judgment. Drowning in the sea of red, the gore of those you watched collapse. Reliving their own tragedies, and see yourself stand unmoving. And those who continue their ways, unheeding of my warning. You will watch in agony, as my words tie themselves into your head, and *force* acknowledgment. Only then, you will learn, taken over by despair and self-loathing. But, then it will be too late, and you will suffer still, for eternity, in the crimson world below.
