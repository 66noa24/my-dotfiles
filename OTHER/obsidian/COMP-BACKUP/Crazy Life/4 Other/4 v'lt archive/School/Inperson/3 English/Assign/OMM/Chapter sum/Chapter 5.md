Here is a detailed summary of Chapter 5 of the provided text, presented in chronological order with fewer bullet points:

*   The chapter opens on a quiet Sunday afternoon in the barn. Lennie is alone in the barn, sitting with his dead puppy. He is distressed and worried about the consequences, fearing that George will discover what happened and prevent him from tending the rabbits on their dream farm. He tries to hide the puppy but feels guilty and contemplates making up a story, only to realize George will know the truth. His frustration and anger lead him to momentarily throw the puppy away, but his sorrow quickly returns.
*   Curley's wife enters the barn quietly and approaches Lennie. Lennie, remembering George's instructions, tries to avoid talking to her, explaining George's rule about staying away from her to avoid trouble and jeopardizing the rabbit-tending dream. Curley's wife dismisses George's fears and her husband, revealing she knows Lennie broke Curley's hand and is impressed by his strength. She expresses her profound loneliness and frustration with her life, complaining that she has no one to talk to except Curley and is trapped on the ranch while the men are playing horseshoes.
*   Lennie, prompted by her question about what he is hiding, reveals the dead puppy. He explains how he accidentally killed it while petting it too hard. Curley's wife attempts to console him by minimizing the loss of the mutt, but Lennie remains focused on the potential loss of the rabbit-tending privilege. She continues to confide in him about her own unfulfilled dreams of becoming a movie star or joining a traveling show, feeling trapped and regretful about her marriage to Curley. She notes that Lennie is "kinda nice" because he listens to her, comparing him to a "big baby."
*   Lennie shifts the conversation back to his love for petting soft things, connecting it to his desire to tend the rabbits and recalling a piece of velvet his Aunt Clara gave him. Curley's wife, receptive to his desire for soft textures, invites him to feel her hair, describing its softness. As Lennie strokes her hair, he does so with increasing force, excited by the feeling. When she tells him to stop because he is messing up her hair, Lennie panics and holds on tightly. Her scream triggers his fear of getting in trouble with George. In a desperate attempt to silence her and prevent George's anger, he covers her mouth and nose with his hand. As she struggles violently, he shakes her and breaks her neck, killing her.
*   Lennie is bewildered and frightened by what he has done, realizing he has committed "a bad thing" and confirming his fear that George will be angry and forbid him from tending the rabbits. He partially covers her body with hay and, remembering George's previous instruction about hiding in the brush by the river if he ever got into trouble, decides to flee. He retrieves the dead puppy, puts it under his coat, and creeps out of the barn.
*   The barn becomes quiet and still, reflecting the death that has occurred. Later, Old Candy comes into the barn looking for Lennie to discuss the dream farm plan further. He discovers the body of Curley's wife and cries out, alerting George, who follows him into the barn. George immediately understands what has happened when he sees Lennie's victim, his face hardening with the realization that their dream of owning land is now impossible.
*   Candy and George discuss the grim situation. Candy, heartbroken that their dream is shattered, desperately asks if they can still get the little place, but George knows it's over, admitting he suspected all along it might never happen. George contemplates their future, which now involves returning to a life of solitary, transient labor. Candy, distraught, lashes out at Curley's wife's dead body, blaming her for ruining their plans.
*   The noise of the horseshoe game outside stops, and the other men, including Slim, Carlson, Whit, and Curley, rush into the barn. Slim examines the body and confirms she was killed by someone with immense strength, recognizing that Lennie is responsible, possibly recalling the incident in Weed. Curley immediately becomes enraged and vows to hunt down and kill Lennie with his shotgun. Carlson also gets his Luger pistol.
*   George confirms Lennie's guilt to Slim and suggests he would have fled south towards their prearranged hiding spot. George expresses concern for Lennie and tries to suggest they bring him in and have him locked up instead of killed, but Slim points out that Curley will want revenge and that institutionalizing Lennie would also be a terrible fate. Carlson discovers his Luger is missing. Curley takes charge of the manhunt, instructing the men on how to pursue Lennie, revealing his intention to shoot Lennie in the gut. Curley orders Whit to get the deputy sheriff.
*   Curley forces George to join the search party, suspicious that he might be involved. George weakly attempts to plead for Lennie, emphasizing that he is mentally disabled and didn't know what he was doing, but Curley is driven by revenge. Slim suggests Curley stay with his wife and tells Candy to remain behind as well. The men, including George under duress, leave the barn to hunt Lennie, leaving Candy alone with the body of Curley's wife. Candy, mourning the loss of their shared future, curses the dead woman before also leaving the barn, crying.
