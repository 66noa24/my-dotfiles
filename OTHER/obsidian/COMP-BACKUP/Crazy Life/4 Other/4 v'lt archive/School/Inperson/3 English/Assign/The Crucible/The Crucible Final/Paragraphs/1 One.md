From as far as the late 1600s, people have been taking advantage of others using disinformation, and still continue on today. Abigail for instance, once realizing she had an unseen authority, took advantage of it and propagated lies around town for her own gain. Much like a portion of media outlets who take advantage of misinformation for their own gain in the present. In *The Crucible*, Arthur Miller demonstrates how certain groups utilize disinformation for their own gain, and how misinformation negatively affects others, justice, and perception of public opinion.
