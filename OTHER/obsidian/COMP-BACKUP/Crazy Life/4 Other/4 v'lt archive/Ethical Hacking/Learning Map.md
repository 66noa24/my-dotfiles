# Ethical Hacking Learning Path
## 1. Programming Fundamentals
Start with essential programming knowledge to automate tasks, understand exploits, and write tools.
- [[Python LM]]
- Bash scripting  
- Regex  
- JavaScript *(especially for XSS/web exploits)*  
- C / C++ *(understand memory management, buffer overflows)*  
- Assembly (x86 / x64) *(low-level exploit understanding)*  
- Go / Rust *(optional, for modern secure tooling)*  
- Understanding APIs (REST, WebSockets)
## 2. Networking Basics
Understanding networking is crucial for analyzing traffic, identifying vulnerabilities, and crafting attacks.
### Fundamentals
- OSI model  
- TCP/IP, UDP  
- Subnetting, CIDR  
- NAT, DNS, DHCP  
### Traffic Analysis
- Wireshark  
- tcpdump  
- PCAP analysis  
### Network Services
- HTTP/HTTPS  
- FTP, SSH, Telnet, SMB  
- SNMP, LDAP  
### Firewall/IDS/IPS Concepts
- Port scanning evasion  
- IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata)
## 3. Operating Systems (Target and Attack Surfaces)
Deep knowledge of OS internals is critical for privilege escalation and persistence.
### Linux (Advanced)
- Permissions  
- Processes and daemons  
- Filesystem hierarchy  
- Cron jobs, systemd  
- Logging systems (journald, syslog, auditd)
### Windows Internals
- Registry  
- Services  
- Event Viewer  
- PowerShell scripting  
- WMI  
### macOS Internals *(optional)*
## 4. Security Concepts
Understand the fundamental theories behind cybersecurity to frame your practical knowledge.
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)  
- Authentication & Authorization  
  - MFA, OAuth, JWT  
  - SAML, LDAP  
- Hashing vs Encryption  
  - MD5, SHA family, bcrypt  
  - AES, RSA (symmetric vs asymmetric)  
- Common Attacks  
  - MITM, replay, DoS/DDoS  
  - Phishing, social engineering  
  - SQLi, XSS, CSRF
## 5. Penetration Testing Techniques
Apply your knowledge in real-world ethical hacking scenarios.
### Methodologies
- Reconnaissance → Scanning → Gaining Access → Maintaining Access → Covering Tracks
### Recon Tools
- Nmap  
- Whois, Dig, theHarvester  
- OSINT (Maltego, Shodan)  
### Vulnerability Scanning  
*(Add tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto, etc.)*
