### Zazen  
Think of zazen not as something you "do" to achieve something, but as the very way you show up to life—just sitting, just being. When you sit in zazen, you let go of grasping, of trying to control or fix anything. You simply settle into your body, your breath, your presence. It’s like opening a window in your mind and letting the fresh air of reality flow through. Dogen said:  

> "Zazen is the Buddha sitting in the ordinary world."  

This means enlightenment is not somewhere else; it’s here, in the simple act of sitting fully awake to this moment. When you sit, don’t chase thoughts or feelings—just let them come and go like clouds in the sky.

### Shikantaza  
This is the heart of zazen—“just sitting.” Imagine sitting without any goal, without trying to get anywhere. You don’t try to clear your mind or reach enlightenment; you simply sit with your whole being. Dogen’s words guide us here:

> "Just sit! Don’t think 'I am sitting.' Don’t think 'I am not sitting.' Don’t think" 


It’s a practice of pure presence, where the boundary between you and sitting dissolves. When you practice Shikantaza, you’re embodying the whole universe in your posture, your breath, your stillness.

### Samu  
Samu is the practice of mindfulness in action—the sacredness of everyday work. Whether you’re sweeping the floor, washing dishes, or gardening, samu invites you to bring your full attention and care to the task. It’s not separate from sitting meditation; it’s sitting meditation in movement. Dogen teaches:

> "When you are doing samu, do samu. When you are eating, eat."  

This means being fully present with whatever you’re doing, without distraction or hurry. In samu, the ordinary becomes extraordinary because your mind is fully there, fully alive.
