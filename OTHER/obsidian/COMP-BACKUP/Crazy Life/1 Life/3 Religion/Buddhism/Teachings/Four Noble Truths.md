### The Four Noble Truths

1. **The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha):**  
Life, as we commonly experience it, involves suffering, dissatisfaction, or unease. This includes obvious pain and loss, but also subtle feelings of impermanence and incompleteness.

2. **The Truth of the Origin of Suffering (Samudaya):**  
Suffering arises from craving, attachment, and ignorance. Our desires and clinging to things as permanent cause distress.

3. **The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Nirodha):**  
It is possible to end suffering by letting go of craving and attachment. This cessation is nirvana, the liberation from the cycle of suffering.

4. **The Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering (Magga):**  
There is a path to end suffering, known as the Noble Eightfold Path, which includes right understanding, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration.

### Excerpt from the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma)  
This is the sutra where the Buddha first taught the Four Noble Truths:

> "Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in short, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering. 
> 
> Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for extermination.  
> 
> Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, nonattachment. 
>  
> Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration."
