### The Four Foundations of Mindfulness

1. **Mindfulness of the Body (Kayanupassana)**  
Being aware of your body—your posture, breathing, movements, and sensations. In Zen, this is the anchor of practice, like feeling the ground beneath you when you sit zazen. It grounds you in the present moment.

2. **Mindfulness of Feelings (Vedanupassana)**  
Observing feelings as they arise—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—without clinging or aversion. This helps you see the impermanent nature of emotions and how they come and go.

3. **Mindfulness of the Mind (Cittanupassana)**  
Noticing the state of your mind—whether it is distracted, focused, joyful, or agitated—without judgment. This awareness helps you understand the mind’s changing nature.

4. **Mindfulness of Mental Objects or Phenomena (Dhammanupassana)**  
Observing thoughts, ideas, and teachings—including the Five Hindrances, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, and the Four Noble Truths—as they arise in your awareness. This deepens insight into how your mind constructs experience.

### How this relates to Zen practice

In Zen, these foundations are not separate exercises but are integrated into zazen and daily life. When you sit, you are mindful of your body and breath; when emotions arise, you notice them clearly; when thoughts come, you observe without attachment; and you recognize the patterns and teachings that arise in your mind.

Dogen’s teaching on zazen embodies this mindfulness fully:  
> "To study the Buddha Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self."  
> — *Shobogenzo, Genjokoan*

This forgetting of the self happens through deep, non-conceptual mindfulness of all aspects of experience.
