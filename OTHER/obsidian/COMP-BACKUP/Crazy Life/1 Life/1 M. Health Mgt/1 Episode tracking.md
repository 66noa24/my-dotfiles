###### Remarks
**07-13 '25** | After maybe a week (?). I just took my lithium again last night. Definitely felt unstable. Maybe even pushed me up. (Was on just Seroquel and Wellbutrin...)

**08-09 '25** | Coming back from about 2 weeks or more off my meds

**08-13 '25** | So, im realizing that I cant really drink like I used to. With my seroquel, it make it feel a lot stronger than what it is. Also, drinking really fucks up with my mood the next day. I think that is why i was in a faux "low" the past few days.
