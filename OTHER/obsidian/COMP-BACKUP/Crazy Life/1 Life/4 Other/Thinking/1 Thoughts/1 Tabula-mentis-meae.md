## PREFACE 0.0
Hello, 
This is a writing of private and personal matters, laid out so that I may have a better understanding of my mind. And if for any reason, future me decides to make this public, then, I ask of you to bear with me this admission, that, the 'Me' writing this never intended for anyone to see. I will utilize multiple points of view (1st, and 2nd). Just be aware that in all cases, it is talking about me.
	(ex.) “I am xyz.” and “You are xyz”. In all of these cases, “You” and “I” are all talking about myself, Noah. ^1606fe
## 1.0 | My Current State (As of October '24) ^ql3
*A quick overview,*
### First person:
I feel as though I am trapped in a glass box, forced to over-analyze every thing I do, yet seemingly have no influence on what happens outside the box. I see the things I do, and realize that they are in fact not helpful, yet I seem powerless to influence them. I want to break the glass, but I can not.
### Second person:
Your inability to find a connection between the actions you do, and what you can do to change them, is the reason you are where you are. Either that you are simply unaware of the lack of connection, or you do in fact know about lack of connection. If the latter, you are either lazy and apathetic to its absence, or struggling to fill the absence. And, you obviously are not the former, because if the former was true, we would not be discussing it right now. (The goal of this paper, is not entirely focused on this matter)

## 2.0 | How I operate socially
### First person reflection:
Socially, I feel alienated. Not because I am alienated by the people around me, but by my inability to operate in the desired way. I feel as though I am overly frank, lacking of empathy, and rather apathetic. I tend towards being what they want to see in me. Which, in platonic instances, is not a bad thing in it of itself. Being fluid in my beliefs, not because I am shallow or flaky in my foundational ideals. But that I find no reason to, in most situations, cause or bring up conflict that would otherwise inhibit the continuing of the relationship. I also find this helpful in solely sexual relationships. (why would I ever bring up conflict with someone I am having a hookup with.) However, where my coping skills rather fall apart is in romantic relationships. Where suddenly, I am unable to mold myself to fit into whatever puzzle I find myself in. I am forced to be “myself” (Whatever in god's name that fucking is.), and try to find the other missing piece. (Sorry for the icky clichés.) 
### Second person reflection:
You feel alienated socially because you lack the social skills. Frankly put, coming to terms with this is the only way. You are Bi-polar, and certainly do not operate in the way the general population does. Now, so far you have been able to find ways around this. But, your avoidance of romantic relationships has proved negative to your social awareness. Now that you have outside pressure on you finding a partner, this has increased the seeming importance of this particular matter. I feel that truly you are overreacting just a little. This is not a matter that is so easily changed. While you can greatly improve how you operate in this sense, it is pointless to look for the perfect potion to clear away all struggles contained in this issue.
## 2.1 | How I operate in platonic social situations ^ql2
### First person reflection:
I find myself rather versatile when it comes to friendships and coworkers. Rarely is there any friction when it comes to making friends or maintaining a level of rapport. I think this is a strength, to be able to form good relationships and “network”. However, I find that while I may have many “colleagues” (for lack of a better word), I don't have many friends. True friends, where I could come up to them about any issue in my life, and us have a helpful and productive discussion about them. Even among the people I call friends, there is really only one or two I would say I have this level of rapport with. (Not an example of a negative thing. It is rather neutral, and I only have said it as an observation.)
	However, I notice that the only time I develop these “colleagues”, is when, in some way, made their own effort to further the relationship. Meaning, that I fail to be the person to initiate these relationships. While I am outgoing, I feel unable to be the “starter”. This is evident by my lack of “true friends” (I *hate* that term). My network is 99.9% of people who don't want to put effort into being something more than what we already were. Even further proof of my inability to initiate is when another person sets up an opportunity for further development. Even if I was fully aware what kind of opportunity it is, and being fully aware of my want for this development, I found myself not doing it. (This idea of my lack of initiation is apparent in all parts of my social pyramid.)
### Second person reflection:
You are generally disinterested in making new friends. You frequently talk about the “ideals” yet find comfort in what you have. You are content with where you are, and the network you have. Your interest and focus on your lack of initiation shows only that you are aware of the perceived issue. You do not dwell further on what you could do to change this. (Going back to the “lack of connection” I talked about in 1.0). Again, here we are, at a bridge with a good many holes in it. Yet, you walk around them, occasionally tripping. While you are simply tripping, and getting across the bridge safe, you inflate these faults to greater than they are. And then after, only talk about the fact that you don't know how to ease this issue. You continue you ponder and think, yet, you have never measured the holes, and try to fix it.
### Cogitare
#### The “holes”:
- My lack of initiation
- My perceived inability to initiate, or, my unwillingness to take the uncomfortable step.
- The lack of self-generated opportunities to initiate.
	- (I talk of being unable to initiate, yet, I never put myself in such positions)
#### My “inflated faults”
- I lack initiation
	- “I don't know”'s 
- I am 'unable' to do xyz
- That the other person doesn't want to talk to me because they see me as someone who they don't like.
	- Not in a sense of general dislike, but that there are qualities of me that causes them to stop.
#### The “actual size of the holes”:
- I struggle with maintaining conversation, along with starting it
- My lack of initiation is NOT because I am inept, but because I have learned to walk around these “holes” specifically, and the idea of trusting the patch fixing the hole to hold my weight is too uncomfortable or over bearing.
#### What I can do to mend the “holes”: `
	(NOTING: This is not in a goal to fix them entirely. For they will still creek under my weight.`
- Put myself into positions to initiate.
- Get used to the uncomfortable-ness of these specific social situations
- Being able to adaptive at the moment, when first starting, as to learn.
- Being positive about change.
	- And disciplined enough to not dismay at smaller issues that may come up.
## 2.2 | How I operate in solely sexual situations.  ^ql1
	(Generally, one-on-one, but, not exclusively.)
	 Disclaimer: This contains exceptionally private thoughts
### First person reflection:
Unlike in 2.0, I find it rather easy to initiate sexual situations. Either this is because of my long-standing “non-innocence”, or because I thrive under the attention of other people in this context. Also, my confidence in my body when it comes to these situations, while I have good body confidence, starts to ebb and flow. 
However, issues come up when the idea of “exclusivity” or any form of commitment is discussed, or attempted. I find it difficult to maintain relationships is discussed, or attempted. I find it difficult to maintain relationships. (Relationships, in [[1 Tabula-mentis-meae#^ql1|2.2]], meaning 'FWB', casual hookup partner. This term excludes one time hookups. \[Simply “hookup”]). This could be from simply the positions I have found myself in, where this difficulty would be expected. For example, I have had only 1 relationship where we were both in proximity, vs. the countless other sexual relationships online. In both examples, I find the same struggle, at the same amplitude. After struggling with the inner turmoil, I find myself simply “ghosting” them. I find it more bearable to simply disappear, than for me to need to explain myself. Explain that I'm not really sure why I feel this way, but that I just don't want to continue this. That I feel “tired of it”, or “lost interest”.
### Second person reflection:
You are self-aware of your own emotions, but when it comes to understanding others, you are undeniably blind. You ghost them because you feel the need to “skip out” on your due part. Your lack of empathy shows this. Which, you empathy, while it is not so easily learned and turned “back on”, you can objectively see and understand the damage that you do. So, empathy or not, you have the understanding of the “damage” you inflict on other people when you selfishly “ghost” them. Your lack of regard for the other person's emotions is evident in all processes from start to finish in these sexual situations.
Now, your lack of initiation is not evident in the same way it is in [[1 Tabula-mentis-meae#^ql2|2.1]] , you start these relationships rather well, but, it is shown more specifically in the act of sex. You dislike starting because you are scared of not “pleasing” them. You enjoy being told what to do. So far, this would make it seem that this is a fundamental part of you. Yet, you have fantasies of control and dominance. Further, proving that you would rather relinquish all control that to have enjoyment in what you do want. (This relating back to the idea of lack of connection discussed in [[1 Tabula-mentis-meae#^ql3|1.0]])
### Cogitare
###### The issues involved in 2.2 are the same 2.1, with a few minor additions:
- My lack of initiation
	Specifically my lack of initiation in sex. (“Pillow princess”)
- My lack of commitment

	My lack of initiation in sex I feel is due to my “ebb and flow of confidence”. I feel like there would be something that they wouldn't like, and then wouldn't say anything about. That they would have these feelings and not communicate them to me. 
## 2.3 How I operate in romantic relationships 
	(This is focusing on the romantic aspect, but, what was discussed in 2.2 is applicable to this.)
### First person reflection:
In romantic relationships I try to be, not the person they want me to be, but set myself up to be a person with good and helpful qualities that benefit both partners. I aim for communication and honesty. (While, in 2.0-1, these qualities can come off and inappropriate and sometimes rude in normal social situations. However, in a romantic relationship, these qualities are beneficial.) I find it most helpful when that is the default. I like to “break down” any “walls” they may have from experience/relationships. I enjoy when both of honest because that enables me, and hopefully the other person, to change how we operate and help the relationship.
The lack of initiation talked about in 2.0-1 is apparent here as well. While, like in 2.2, I have the initiation to start talking to somebody, I lose it when talking about things that I think should change, or breaking up with them. My lack of initiation in discussing things that I think need changed is Ironic because I am so adamant about open communication. Just like my issues with initiating during sex, I am fearful that may think that what I'm asking to change is either fine how it was, or that me asking for a change is fundamentally unreasonable. I lack the self integrity to tell them to change what was happening, and would like it more when I work to fit in these person's specific puzzle (2.0).
### Second person reflection:
You aim for open and frank communication. You believe this is the main quality that makes relationships successful. While you strive for this air of honesty, you lack the courage to make a change to something, even if it is significant. Then, after a mental list is formed of everything that you want to see changed, but never ask, starts to weigh on you. It slowly impacts other parts of your life until you become bothered enough, you ghost them. Going back to the common theme of lacking of initiation. For if you had spoken up about these issues, you could have been able to work things through together, and possibly end up with an even greater relationship. 
### Cogitare
###### Apparent issues
- My lack of confidence to bring up specific perceived issues with S/O
- My continual lack of initiation with breaking up. 
- My slowly built up resentment, that leads to a quick and cold cut off.
## 2.4 My reflective overview of the past chapter, outlining a plan
			(Note: That 2.4 is not specific to platonic, sexual, or romantic relationships. This is all encompassing.)
### Issues:
- My lack of initiation in furthering relationships.
	- Putting myself in positions to further a relationship.
- My lack of initiation in sex, and in communicating issues.
- My avoidance of “properly” breaking up.
- My lack of commitment.
- My difficulty with “small talk” and empathy
### Why's:
- My difficulty with small talk, and lacking the skills to do such.
- My fear of the other person's thoughts, that they may not like what I did.
- I dislike the uncomfortable feeling of breaking up.
- My lack of commitment is because I don't communicate issues, leading to me “blowing”.
- Is probably due to bipolar, as well, lack of tools.
### My Plan:
My lack of initiation in furthering relationships is because I find small talk hard, as well as a general lacking of skills. This is benefited by, in work or school, practice small talk. My overall issue is my resentment of taking a step out of my comfort zone. I should practice stepping into, and staying in, my comfort zone. Exposure therapy.

My lack of initiation in sex is because I don't want them to be thinking something bad of me in the moment. Again, talking about stepping out into your comfort zone. 

My avoidance of a proper break up is because I dislike the uncomfortable feeling of it. Again, the avoidance of something uncomfortable. 
	
My lack of commitment is because I fail to communicate issues, which then leads to a slow build up of resentment, then to me ghosting. Getting used to saying things openly and communicating them will help remedy this. Once again, not stepping out of my comfort zone.

My difficulty with small talk and empathy is most likely due to Bipolar. This is something that is harder to “fix”, but we can help it by practicing. 

###### *Plan brief:*
I need to, in positions I find my self in, practice stepping out of my comfort zone in all cases stated above. Do this according to everything stated above. And when noticing one of these issues come up in real life, stop and think about ways to help its case. Making sure to not over inflate the “holes”, and to continually “measure the holes”, to keep yourself updated on your own mind's processing of these issues.

## ==REF/INS== 1.0 | Feb 28, '25
Assuming there will be breaks throughout this writing, I have added a tag. Highlighted text in the heading is the tag. REF/INS means **ref**lection and **ins**ight. Since the last time I have written, in October of 24, I have most definitely become more self-aware of myself. In fact, some of the things I have said earlier and the headings above this one, specifically about my lack of empathy, have ended up being false. I in fact am very empathetic, but I lack the skills to communicate it in such a way that it comes across as warm and inviting. I would also like to note that whenever I was last writing on here, I was going into a depressive episode. This depressive was the worst in the sense that I had extremely high self-disgust. This is easily evident in my second person point of view reflections. 
However, I will not revise the earlier text. In continuance with the original set of ideals for this writing, I will not make marks on what's been written. Why? Because it is in it's way a history of my mind. I am able to look back on what I was thinking, and then come back to this reflection and understand where I grew and where I may have fallen in terms of cognizance.
In this reflection also, I would like to add how I may be changing the format of this writing. Instead of hierarchical organization, it will instead be chronological. For example, while the last “current state” was indeed labeled 1.0, after this reflection I may add another “current state” under heading 3.0, and then continue on at 4.0.
