# Muscle Hypertrophy

## Definition
Muscle hypertrophy refers to the increase in the size of muscle fibers, leading to an overall increase in muscle mass.

## Mechanisms of Hypertrophy

1. **Mechanical Tension**
   - Created when lifting weights, activating mechanoreceptors in muscle cells.
   - Stimulates pathways that promote muscle growth.
   - **Reps and Sets**: Typically 6-12 reps and 3-5 sets.

2. **Metabolic Stress**
   - Accumulation of metabolites (lactate, hydrogen ions) during higher-rep sets.
   - Stimulates muscle growth through activation of anabolic hormones.
   - **Rest Intervals**: Shorter (60-90 seconds) to enhance metabolic stress.

3. **Muscle Damage**
   - Eccentric contractions cause micro-tears in muscle fibers.
   - Triggers repair processes involving satellite cells, increasing muscle size.
   - **Training Volume**: Higher volume (total sets x reps) promotes greater muscle damage.

## Summary
Hypertrophy training emphasizes muscle size and volume, focusing on mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage through moderate reps and shorter rest periods.
