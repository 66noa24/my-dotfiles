### Items Needed:
([[Items I have]])
- **Rose Buds and Petals**: For love and attraction.
- **Peppermint Leaf**: To promote clarity and communication.
- **Skullcap**: To ease anxiety and hesitation.
- **Allspice**: To enhance luck and attraction.
- **Red Candle**: To symbolize passion and desire.
- **Spell Jar**: Use the one with a lid for sealing your intentions.

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare Your Space**: Find a quiet space where you can focus. Light some sage and use it to cleanse your area and the items you will be using.

2. **Set Your Intention**: Take a moment to visualize the person you want to contact you. Focus on the feelings you want to evoke in them—ease, comfort, and a desire to reach out.

3. **Layer the Ingredients**:
   - Start by adding a layer of **Rose Buds and Petals** to the bottom of the jar. As you do this, say something like, "With love and attraction, I call you near."
   - Next, add a layer of **Peppermint Leaf** for clarity. Say, "May clarity guide your thoughts to me."
   - Add a layer of **Skullcap** to ease their hesitation. Say, "Let anxiety fade, and courage grow."
   - Sprinkle in some **Allspice** for luck. Say, "With luck and charm, I draw you close."
   
4. **Seal Your Intentions**: Once you’ve added all the ingredients, close the jar with the lid. Hold the jar in your hands and visualize your intention manifesting. Imagine the person feeling compelled to reach out to you.

5. **Light the Red Candle**: Place the candle next to the jar and light it. As the candle burns, say, "With this flame, I ignite the passion and desire for connection."

6. **Let It Sit**: Allow the candle to burn down completely if possible, or extinguish it safely if you need to leave it unattended. Keep the spell jar in a special place where you can see it, allowing the energy to build.

7. **Follow Up**: After a few days, you can repeat the process or light the candle again to reinforce your intention.

### Closing:
Remember to keep your intentions positive and respectful of the other person's free will. This spell is meant to ease hesitation and encourage communication, not to force anyone against their will.
