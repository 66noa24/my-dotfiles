# Spell Jar for Romantic Connection

## Items Needed:
- A spell jar (with lid)
- White candle (for purity and clarity)
- Purple candle (for spiritual connection and love)
- **Herbs:**
  - Rose buds and petals (for love and romance)
  - Hibiscus flower (to attract love and passion)
  - Skullcap (to ease anxiety and hesitation)
  - Bay laurel (for protection and success in communication)
  - Alfalfa leaf (to bring good fortune)
- Drawing powder (to attract positive energy)
- Incense (Sage & Citrus for cleansing and positive energy)

## Instructions:

1. **Cleansing the Space:**
   - Begin by cleansing your space. Light the Sage & Citrus incense and allow the smoke to fill the area. As you do this, visualize any negative energy dissipating.

2. **Setting Your Intention:**
   - Sit quietly and focus on your intention. Visualize Drayson feeling warm, romantic memories about you and being open to communication. Speak your intention out loud, affirming that you want to create a connection.

3. **Preparing the Jar:**
   - Take the spell jar and add the following layers:
     - A layer of rose buds and petals for love.
     - A layer of hibiscus flower for attraction.
     - A layer of skullcap to ease his hesitation.
     - A layer of bay laurel for successful communication.
     - A layer of alfalfa leaf for good fortune.
     - A sprinkle of drawing powder to attract positive energy.

4. **Sealing the Jar:**
   - Once you’ve added all the herbs, close the jar with the lid. Hold the jar in your hands and visualize your intention flowing into it. Imagine the feelings you want to evoke in Drayson being infused into the jar.

5. **Candle Ritual:**
   - Place the jar in front of you and light the white candle on one side and the purple candle on the other. As the candles burn, focus on the flames and visualize your intention manifesting. You can say a chant or affirmation like:
     - “With love and light, I call to thee, 
       Let memories flow, let hearts be free.  
       Open the path for words to share,  
       With love and kindness, I show I care.”

6. **Final Steps:**
   - Allow the candles to burn down completely if possible, or extinguish them safely if you need to leave them. Keep the jar in a special place where you can see it often, reminding you of your intention.

7. **Follow-Up:**
   - After a few days, you can take the jar and shake it gently while focusing on your intention again. This will help to reinforce the energy you’ve put into the spell.

**Remember:** The key to any spell is your intention and belief in the process. Good luck, and may your connection with Drayson deepen!
