*   **F. Scott Fitzgerald's novels:** The party scenes in Fitzgerald's novels, particularly *The Great Gatsby*, were often based on real events, although transformed by a "nostalgic, liquid haze" [1]. *The Great Gatsby* is often hailed as the quintessential portrait of the Jazz Age, depicting lavish parties and the era's excess, decadence, and wealth [2, 3]. His novel *Tender is the Night* also showcases the opulence of parties during this time [5].

*   **Other authors and works:** There's mention of a long poem that vividly describes a wild 1920s party [4]. Additionally, several books transport readers to the 1920s, capturing the spirit of the time [6].

The poem you're likely referring to is "The Wild Party" by Joseph Moncure March [1]. It's a novel-length poem that vividly describes a 1920s party. I can't include the full text here due to its length, but you can find it at The Modern Theater [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
