    2.  **Psychological Basis:** Rapport is rooted in several key psychological factors:

        *   *Positive Affect:* When we experience positive emotions in the presence of someone, we are more likely to develop rapport. This can be triggered by shared laughter, mutual interests, or simply feeling understood.
        *   *Perceived Similarity:* We tend to like people who are similar to us, whether in terms of values, beliefs, interests, or even background. This perceived similarity creates a sense of comfort and trust.
