**1. Understand the Root of Your Self-Consciousness:**
*   **Identify triggers:** Pay attention to situations or thoughts that make you feel most self-conscious. Is it when you're talking about your past, expressing your opinions, or during moments of intimacy?
*   **Challenge negative thoughts:** Once you identify the triggers, challenge the negative thoughts associated with them. Are they based on facts, or are they assumptions? For example, if you think "He's going to think I'm boring," ask yourself, "Is there evidence to support that? Has he ever said or done anything to make me believe that?"
*   **Past experiences:** Consider if past relationship experiences might be influencing your current feelings. Were there instances where you felt rejected or judged? Recognizing these patterns can help you address them more effectively.
**2. Build Self-Esteem and Self-Love:**
*   **Practice self-compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend. When you make a mistake or feel insecure, avoid self-criticism. Instead, acknowledge your feelings and remind yourself that everyone experiences these emotions.
*   **Focus on your strengths:** Make a list of your positive qualities, accomplishments, and things you like about yourself. Refer to this list when you're feeling self-conscious.
*   **Engage in activities you enjoy:** Pursue hobbies, interests, and activities that make you feel good about yourself. This will boost your confidence and self-worth.
**3. Communicate Openly with Your Partner:**
*   **Share your feelings:** Find a comfortable time to talk to your partner about your self-consciousness. Be honest about your fears and insecurities, but also emphasize that you're working on them. For example, you could say, "Sometimes I feel a little insecure in this relationship, even though I know you care about me. I'm working on it, but I wanted to be open with you about how I'm feeling."
*   **Ask for reassurance:** It's okay to ask for reassurance from your partner, but try to do it in a way that doesn't put pressure on them. Instead of saying "Do you really like me?", you could say, "It would mean a lot to me if you could remind me sometimes how you feel about me."
*   **Active listening:** When your partner is talking, focus on truly listening to what they're saying, rather than worrying about what you're going to say next. This will help you feel more connected and less self-conscious.
**4. Shift Your Focus:**
*   **Focus on the present:** Instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, concentrate on enjoying the present moment with your partner. Engage in activities that you both find fun and meaningful.
*   **Focus on your partner's positive qualities:** Instead of focusing on your own insecurities, pay attention to the things you admire and appreciate about your partner. This will help you feel more grateful for the relationship and less self-conscious.
*   **Focus on building connection:** Engage in activities that foster connection and intimacy, such as deep conversations, shared experiences, and acts of service.
**5. Practice Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques:**
*   **Mindful breathing:** When you start to feel self-conscious, take a few deep breaths. Focus on the sensation of the breath entering and leaving your body. This can help calm your nerves and bring you back to the present moment.
*   **Grounding exercises:** Use your senses to ground yourself in the present. Notice five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.
*   **Meditation:** Regular meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. This can make it easier to manage self-conscious thoughts.
**6. Seek Professional Help:**
*   **Therapy:** If your self-consciousness is significantly impacting your relationships and overall well-being, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your self-consciousness and develop coping strategies.
**Important Considerations:**
*   **Be patient:** Overcoming self-consciousness takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and celebrate your progress along the way.
*   **Avoid seeking constant validation:** While it's okay to ask for reassurance from your partner occasionally, avoid constantly seeking validation. This can be draining for your partner and reinforce your insecurities.
*   **Remember your worth:** Remind yourself that you are worthy of love and happiness, just as you are. Your partner chose to be with you because they see something special in you.
