#Poems

In a library, 
With infinite writings,  
There is a hall, a room, a shelf, a book.  
  
  
A book of terror and agony,  
I read and read.  
  
  
I have the authority,  
To burn, ruin, and shred this book.  
  
  
I read and read,  
The dread consumes me.  
  
  
I must eradicate.  

  
Still I read and read,  
The Inconsolable depression dominates me.  
  
  
I will burn this book, for the terrors of its writing to to much to bear,  
Too much for any soul to be bound by.  
  
  
But am unable to destroy,  
The book, weaving into my fingers, body, and mind.  
  
  
I discern, my hands, writing this book,  
I am helpless to end.  
  
  
_For this book is my life,  
And even the boundlessness of this athenaeum  
Would not be complete without these words._
