#Poems

The moon rests in the sky outside my window, I am already awake and out the door,
	The trail I wish to climb, calls to my soul.
	A long-awaited expedition.
I am driving well before the first ray of sun hits my skin,
	The long drive ahead, I must beat the sun.
	A head start on my journey, 
A bottle of medicine rattles with the jolts of my car,
	The sound rings in my head, but I must focus.
	For it is just one day without them…
I am faster than normal, the unsteady jolts of my hands and feet as I steer the car,
	Well above the speed limit.
	Every second that goes by, is a minute lost.
The company of this trail, like a long-lost childhood friend, I’ve never been able to fully enjoy its presence.
	My body aches for its completion, an effort long abhorred,
	I will finish, the ambition and motivation courses through my every movement.
As I park, the sun warms my face with its shallow glow.
	I grab my few items and haste to the trail,
	I have no time to waste.
I start up the trail, but a sign blocking my way forces me to read,
	“Beware, sudden end to trail, if you are otherwise unprepared, turn back!”
	I barely comprehend, for no matter will block this trails completion.
	If I must, like Shiva, I will destroy this land to make a path, I will make this summit.
This trail, open to the world, no obstacles.
	A quick pace I set, I will be there by nightfall.
A hike, the cold air burning my nose and lungs,
	Sweat drips down my face,
	and my legs, like a windup toy, will run relentlessly till I am done.
I will not slow, I can not, the summit is seemingly inches away from my fingertips, 
	I burn, I have not slowed and never will.
This trail winds and winds to a dusty end, my hands and arms a shield now.
	I hardly slow, a flash of the sign in my memory,
	Briars and thistles slowly surround me.
They scrape and cut my arms and legs.
	A burn and pain that only motivates me,
	Compared to my ambition, this is but a scrape on my knee.
I make it so close to the end before the night falls,
	I stop in pure horror.
	So much to go and it is already night!
	I look for a clearing that is not there.
I flatten the brush and lay down.
	The spikes, piercing my back as I try to sleep.
	I will not notice the blood trailing down my legs.
I lay, the pain reaching through my body to my mind.
	I wince, I must sleep, to get this night done through.
But I am unable, I toss and turn my head.
	The night falls on me like an empty blanket.
	The animals, the birds, they’re watching me to no end,
	Every turn of their body and step of their feet shake my soul.
I am barren and empty, unprepared for this nightfall.
	Finally, I am asleep, the paresthesia slinking up my body.
	I dream of terror, the sound and feeling of animals eating at my exposed flesh,
	Having a meal of me, licking at my cuts
Now I am awake, but I am paralyzed, it holds me down.
	The small feeling of needles in my legs rises,
	It becomes a blood-curdling scream compared to my pain.
Now the morning, the sun releases me from the night,
	I am too scared to look at my legs.
	A pain like a bat to my shins with every step I take,
	For the fear that what I thought was a dream might be reality.
I run, I sprint, the terrors of this place have an end.
	The summit, I am but 2 miles away, a run will have me there.
I see ahead, only the thickening of the endlessness of thorns,
	The pain that echoes my body, my only comfort and motivator.
	I will not stop.
There is no other option,
	I see the fall of the trees, of the beginning of light.
I sprint, my arms building momentum for my exhausted body.
	Cuts begin to open on my clothes and arms,
	The pain motivates me more still, a pleasure against the endlessness of my mind.
I run to the edge of the mountain, a cliff greets me.
	I look out, I stand on the summit, it welcomes me with the warm sun.
	I sit down and take in this sight.
The blood draining onto the stone I rest,
	I become dizzy and laugh.
	But it does not stop.
The laughter takes me over and I drain and drain yet…
        I stand, and I scream,
	'For I am god! Nothing will end me except by my discretion!'
	But I slip…
I fall for ages, my ragdoll body hits and rolls on the side of the mountain.
	I lay at the bottom, wheezing and laughing.
	My body lies mangled and contorted under the empty shadow of this mountain.
I croak, as the blood fills my lungs,
          'I will not stop!' 
Laughter eats away at my body and mind
	For I am god!


This hike, my life,
	The mania looms over me and takes over my soul.
	I will complete anything I want.
For this trail, I so blindly followed,
	The rats liked my blood, the lacerations wrapped around my body like a swaddled child.
        The crows ate at my wounds,
	Then and still, I am nothing but a rotting corpse, another pile to be claimed by the forest.
For my medicine, I did not take today
	“It is just one day”
	The mantra of my life as every day goes by.
The sullen depression after a manic rage will eat at my mind till there is nothing left.
	Like the storm of a sailor, greybeards of terror till it all clears in a second

Then, like clockwork, the mania will consume me, driving me to my delusional ends, simply for the depression to feast on. 
Like clockwork, so the next has a victim to lay down and butcher.
