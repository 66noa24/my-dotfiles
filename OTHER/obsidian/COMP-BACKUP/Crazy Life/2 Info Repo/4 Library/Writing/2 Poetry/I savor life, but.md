I savor my life.
But,
If Azrael were to take me.
I will blithely go,
His path as clear as the m√•ngata

I savor my life.
My actions believing.
Not a blink till I am relieved

I savor my life.
But,
My mind is a fire,
a searing pain as blisters form

I savor my life.
But,
Like the victim of a charring building,
I will jump.

I savor my life.
But,
The cold embrace of demise is the only console.

I savor my life.
But,
For death to me is the only escape.

Like the victim of a building ablaze,
I will jump for the anguish of my mind.
To clear this fever.

I do not want to die.
But,
_I will choose the null of end,_

_For it is far better than the agony I know so well._
