#### Info
As of 05-21 '25, we do not have a label. But, this relationship is meaningful to me.
His birthday is March third, two thousand. He is super aware of what he eats. ADHD. And he does not know cursive. Blue eyes, blond. Athletic. Caring.

**06-03 '25** | just kissed me in the restaurant. Public. Wow. The most PDA I ever have really had with me. Makes me feel good that he wanted to do it. Like of his own will. Cool üòé 

**06-04 '25** **08:44** awesome time

**06-07 '25** | we had a super fun time at the beach. I start taking my meds, and it really helped me a lot with my feelings with him. I think I do love him actually.

**06-10 '25** | Things are going good. I will say though that compared to the beach there is a little friction again. But nothing near as bad as before. Med changes + Vacation = no stress and just the right environment. It was good for us. I'm learning slowly how much he cares about me. 

**06-15 '25** | At his house right now. I feel good. We drank last night. Idk, right now I'm just kind of like, tired. Idk. Sometimes I feel like I want him to like, touch me you know. Sometimes I feel weird about it. But, we have different ways of showing love. But it's also on me to communicate with him about what I need. But it makes it so hard to communicate whenever we don't have a label. We use the word "relationship", but never boyfriend or, another term of endearment. He calls me "cutie" a lot. Idk. I just need to take my meds, legit. Lol

**06-23 '25** | So, today and [[06-22, Su '25|yesterday]] went well. This relationship is definitely something I want. But, the need for med compliance and emotional regulation is more than it ever was before if that is what I want. To quote Laurent, "*In order to get what you want, you need to know exactly what you're willing to give up for it.*"
Here are some thoughts I have
	A few days ago when I stayed, I was not in a good place emotionally. I just wanted to be alone, but I came over anyway because I want to be with him. (contradictory emotions) But, at night, he did cuddle me of his own will. Which in the moment made me feel really bad. In afterthought thought, it helps with my anxious attachment style. This is an instance that I can call on when I'm doubting if he does want to be with me. 
	Going off on the same note. Today he said, roughly, "You know you can stay more than one night? Don't feel like you're *overstaying your welcome.*" Whenever he said that, I felt seen. It gave me some confidence with this. Stay on my meds, get through the lows and highs.

**06-26 '25** | So I was at his house last night and this morning. I stayed over. He just does small things that upset me.

**06-28 '25** | Okay, so, idk. Today I was talking with Chelsea and Alanha about me and Drayson. Basicly, IDK if this is something that can work long term... But, I do like him. FUCK. I dont even know what to do anymore. Because he is truly a one in a million person. He is smart, has interestes that other people dont. He enjoy's the fact that I am also smart, and have hobbies that other people dont. But somethings like when I was telling him about the Tree Leaf sangha (this was a few days ago, I didnt write about it.) he just sort of shot it down. He said, "How do you know that those are the words of Buddha and not just the disciples putting their own words in?" What I said in my head in responce to that was "I can say the same thing about the bible." But I didn't, I kept it to myself. Then it put me in a mood. HOWEVER.... I am also noticing that the "moods" I get in are partially my fault. 

Also, this is something I am notice. So, we first met in [['25 Jan|January]]. Which was the start of my manic episode, and during that time I often had self doubts. And, in [['25 May|may]] when my depressive episode started, it turned into it projecting onto him. But, what I'm thinking is that the things that cause my self doubt and the projected irritation was all caused by the same thing. Now, this is cause is either from me, or from him. If it's from me, then I do not know currently what I am doing or thinking or feeling that would be the cause. But if it is him, then it is something that I can not change. 

**06-30 '25** | Yup, today was it. I'm done. Cant. Stubborn, not open minded. **Not compatible** 

**07-03 '25** | "are you just going to stay in miff for your whole life?" "Are you just going to go your whole life without talking to anyone?"

**08-03 '25** | I'm so sorry.
