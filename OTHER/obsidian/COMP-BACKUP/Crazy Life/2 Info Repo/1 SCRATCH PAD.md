I can learn this by constantly and never stopping because it will help with memorisation. As well as... It being a good and simple form of mental stimulation and it will help with my own memory... Good fucking luck to me I guess!

Hey, so, I need to say something, and I'm kinda embarrassed/disgusted. I just got a text when I was skiing from someone I saw early last week. He had told me that he tested positive for throat gonorrhea. I don't think we should kiss Wednesday if you still want me to come up. I'm going to the urgent care or state health center tmrw to see about an appt for a screening. I had been kind of panicked when I got it, and why I didn't snap the rest of the evening. But I needed to say something to you,

Hey, can we talk for a second?

I just want to have an open conversation about where we're both at with this. I know this is probably something better talked about in person, but its been giving me some anxiety and I wanted to say something sooner. If you'd want to call about it we can.

When we first started talking, it was more casual, but its become something more than that for me. I wanted to communicate that so we are both aware of where we stand. If we are hoping for different things to come out of this then I might want to step back and rethink things. It would be emotionally draining for me to be talking with someone i wanted to be with, and knew I wouldn't. I want to be honest with myself and you about this. I also don't want this to seem like a pressure, that I'm expecting an answer now, or that this is an ultimatum. 

I really enjoy my time with you. Your someone I see myself growing with. But, I also know that you have anxieties about this, because of past experiences, and I want to be sensitive and understanding of that.
